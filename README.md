# VarHound (VH)

VH is a suite for genomic variant storage, retrieval, and validation through coverage analysis. It includes Python/R tools
for the storage, management, and retrieval of large VCF files. In addition, VH offers a set of sample-level and region-level
validation tools, through coverage analysis. VH is originally designed for truSight oncology 500 (TSO500) assays, but 
can be applied to any other DNA/RNA sequencing panel.
